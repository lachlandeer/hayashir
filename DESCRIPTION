Description: Graduate students new to both PhD level econometrics and **R** may
    find the introduction to both challenging. One major challenge can be
    finding the empirical data to complete a Problem Set and then loading it
    into **R**. The `hayashir` data package intends to lighten the load on
    readers of Hayashi's "Econometrics" who want to follow the empirical
    parts of the text using `R`. The package contains all data used in the book
    and documentation for each data set is included. Once the package is 
    installed and loaded, all data are ready to use with minimal fuss.
